## Description

A web application that helps users track their daily food intake and receive recommended meals based on what they have eaten. 
Users can enter what they have eaten and we can calculate food nutrition facts and see what nutrient they lack and recommend meals based on that. 
For example if they have had no carbs yet maybe we recommend food options with carbs such as pasta, rice, bread etc.



## links to the container images for each custom subsystem, hosted on DockerHub.



## instructions for how to set up any environment variables and import any starter data into the database, as necessary, for the system to operate correctly when run.




## if there are any "secret" configuration files, such as .env or similar files, that are not included in the version control repository, examples of these files, such as env.example, with dummy data must be included in the repository and exact instructions for how to create the proper configuration files and what their contents should be must be supplied to the course admins by the due date.
